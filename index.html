    <h1>Australian Shepherds!</h1>

    <p>
        The Australian Shepherd, often known simply as the "Aussie", is a medium-sized breed of
        dog that was, despite its name, developed on ranches in the United States during the 19th
        century. There is disagreement regarding the exact history of the breed prior to its arrival
        in the United States, and thus no official consensus on the origin of its name or association
        with Australia.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are similar in appearance to the popular English Shepherd and Border Collie breeds,
        and research has found that Australian Shepherds and Border Collies are closely related to
        each other; both the Border Collie and Australian Shepherd are slightly more distantly
        related to other kinds of Collies from the Basque regions of Europe.[7] However, the Border
        Collie was not used to create the Australian Shepherd. The Australian Shepherd most likely
        is the descendant of Carea Leon√©s, Pyrenean Shepherd and Old German Herding dogs that were
        brought over by shepherds.

        For many years, Aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability.
        While they continue to work as stock dogs and compete in herding trials, they have earned
        recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please and are highly
        regarded for their skills in obedience.[9] Like all working breeds, Aussies have considerable
        energy and drive. They often excel at dog sports such as dog agility and frisbee and are also
        highly successful as search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, detection dogs, guide dogs,
        service dogs, and therapy dogs. They are considered the 17th-most popular dog breed in the
        United States.
